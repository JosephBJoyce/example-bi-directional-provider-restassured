# Example RestAssured Provider

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pactflow/example-provider-restassured.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pactflow/example-provider-restassured)

This is an example of a Spring boot API provider that uses RestAssured, [Pactflow](https://pactflow.io) and its [bi-directional contracts feature](https://pactflow.io/blog/bi-directional-contracts/) to ensure that it is compatible with the expectations its consumers have of it.

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

It is using a public tenant on Pactflow, which you can access [here](https://test.pactflow.io) using the credentials `dXfltyFMgNOFZAxr8io9wJ37iUpY42M`/`O5AIZWxelWbLvqMd8PkAVycBJh2Psyg1`. The latest version of the Example Consumer/Example Provider pact is published [here](https://test.pactflow.io/pacts/provider/pactflow-example-provider/consumer/pactflow-example-consumer/latest).


## Pre-requisites

**Software**:

* Tools listed at: https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/workshops/ci-cd/set-up-ci/prerequisites/
* A pactflow.io account with an valid [API token](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/getting-started/#configuring-your-api-token)
#### Environment variables

To be able to run some of the commands locally, you will need to export the following environment variables into your shell:

* `PACT_BROKER_TOKEN`: a valid [API token](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/getting-started/#configuring-your-api-token) for Pactflow
* `PACT_BROKER_BASE_URL`: a fully qualified domain name with protocol to your pact broker e.g. https://testdemo.pactflow.io

### Usage

* `make test` - run the tests locally
* `make fake_ci` - run the CI process locally
